# 12 years of 'machine learning' engineering in a blink

!!! note
    This article is non technical and personal.
    The reader may not get much out of it as it intends
    to help myself shape the next decade of objectives to pursue.
    Making it public is a desired constraint to flesh it out more plainly.

I am a father since two weeks and the priority of my life just changed forever.
It's time to take a step back and think of my professional career.

I am amazed by how fast time have passed.
It has been 12 years already forging machine learning applications as a living.

From start-ups of my early days to entrepreneurship, then freelancing and big company,
it's always thrilling to apply cutting edge research from dozen to millions of customer devices.

What a lucky man I am, paid to read scientific articles, implements and improve
over ideas at the frontier of what is known possible. Moreover doing it in one of
the hottest field of our time that is deep learning.

The journey have been good to me until now.
Along the way I even got opportunity to share some of that joy back to the community,
by [an article accepted to ICASSP in 2021](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tV8RVtcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra),
a published an open source library [torch-to-nnef](https://github.com/sonos/torch-to-nnef) this year, or regular
contributions to [tract](github.com/sonos/tract) an open source neural network rust inference engine.

Still I would be lying saying it's have been a perfect honeymoon:

- So many projects, so many urgent features that where of core importance back then.
Most, merely useful at some point in time and so few withstanding the test of time.
Sometime it feels our industry is just an house of card slowly but continually churning.
Dinosauria we.

As I grow old I am more and more attracted by those public projects that stands still.
